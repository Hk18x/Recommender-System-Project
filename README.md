# Recommender-System-Project
# Project Scenario

Assume you are a new machine learning engineer in a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) startup called AI Training Room. In AI Training Room, learners across the world can learn leading technologies such as Machine Learning, AI, Data Science, Cloud, App development, etc. Your company grows rapidly and reaches millions of learners in a very short period.

The learning topics of AI Training Room can be summarized in the following word cloud:

Starting this year, your machine learning engineer team is working very hard on a recommender system project. The main goal of this project is to improve learners' learning experience via helping them quickly find new interested courses and better paving their learning paths. Meanwhile, with more learners interacting with more courses via your recommender systems, your company's revenue may also be increased.

This project is currently at the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase so your main focus at this moment is to explore and compare various machine learning models and find one with the best performance in off-line evaluations.

# Your Tasks
Your tasks in this project are summarized in the following workflow, and you will be guided through them in hands-on labs.

More specifically, you will undertake the tasks of:

1. Collecting and understanding data

2. Performing exploratory data analysis on online course enrollments datasets

3. Extracting Bag of Words (BoW) features from course textual content

4. Calculating course similarity using BoW features

5. Building content-based recommender systems using various unsupervised learning algorithms, such as:
Distance/Similarity measurements, K-means, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), etc.

6. Building collaborative-filtering recommender systems using various supervised learning algorithms
K Nearest Neighbors, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Neural Networks, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, RandomForest, etc.
